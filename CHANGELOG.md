## v0.3b1-2

- As the v0.3b1 (Preview 1) build is no longer available from Coolstar's repository, this version repackages it. The patches are no longer done on the device.

- Instead of using Cydia's cydia.list file, the package now comes with the default repositories as some repositories cause Sileo to break.
